## Developing and Testing

It's best to use a virtual environment to test and develop new features. We recommend `pyenv` or `conda`:
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

Having one of these installed makes the developing process easier, helping the user with depency management.

If you need to add a new dependency, make sure to add it to the corresponding `requirements` file:
- `requirements.txt`: General project dependencies. Anything that the main version needs must be added here.
- `requirements.lint.txt`: Lint dependencies, `flake8` for example.
- `requirements.test.txt`: Dependencies needed for the testing phase.

### Useful Commands

After the initial steps, you can use some useful commands to help your developing process:

1. **Requirements:**
  - `make requirements`: installs all packages from all requirements files
  - `make requirements-lint`: installs all packages from `requirements.lint.txt` file
  - `make requirements-tests`: installs all packages from `requirements.tests.txt` file
2. **Lint:**
  - `make checks`: runs `black` and `flake8`
  - `make black`: runs only the `black` reformating process
  - `make flake8`: runs only the `flake8` lint process
3. **Tests:**
  - `make tests`: runs `pytest` with coverage
